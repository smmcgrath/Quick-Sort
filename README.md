# Quick-Sort
Quick Sort is another example of a sorting technique which uses divide and conquer algorithm. It requires the identification of an arbitrary 'pivot' point (ideally somewhere near the centre) around which the other values of the array are ordered relatively. This pivot creates a partition in the array. To the left of the pivot, we aim to place the values which are smaller than it and to the right the larger values.
